To do -
1. Connect kinect to your pc and ensure all the kinect drivers are installed before running the program.

( If module 1, then)
2. Information about the 1st module which is an integration interface, On the home screen you can see three green buttons at the bottom of the screen. Press any button to activate that module. 
Currently, it has some glitches because we are integrating it as an app but it isn't a perfect app yet. The modules are running good individually but behaves differently if you navigate between the modules(we are unable to turn of the audios while switching between the modules).

( If module 2, then)
3. When running the program, you will have a 10 second timer to select your required mp4 file, This 10 second time is used for dealing the null pointerexception. 
[For ease of use we have the put the path to be a local video wich can be changes in code.]
4. Once the video is up and playing use your right hand to toggle the buttons on screen. You can see ur hand in the form of a point ball on the screen.

( If Module 3 or 4)
5. Use your right hand to control all the buttons on the screen to toggle.

- The functions have been created to draw the skeleton of Left and Right hand. 
- The program plays an audio, video or image files according to selected output module.
